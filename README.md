# My Documents by David Bertalan

A list of my public projects that have something to do with writing or publishing.

> Note: redered by GitHub Pages.

## [DITA-OT/docs contributions](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Athendarion+archived%3Afalse+repo%3Adita-ot%2Fdocs+)

My pull requests in the DITA Open Toolkit Documentation projects. Ever growing.

## [DITA CV to PDF](https://github.com/thendarion/dita-cv-to-pdf) 
 
This project contains a custom DITA-OT plugin that enables writing CV and Cover Letter source files in DITA format and rendering them as PDF.

## [TimberHUN translation mod](https://github.com/thendarion/timberborn-magyaritas)

A big Hungarian translation mod for Timberborn. Way more effort than I would care to admit. Still worth it though.
