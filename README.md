# My Documents by David Bertalan

A list of my public projects that have something to do with writing or publishing. 

## [DITA CV to PDF](https://github.com/thendarion/dita-cv-to-pdf) 
 
This project contains a custom DITA-OT plugin that enables writing CV and Cover Letter source files in DITA format and rendering them as PDF.

## [TimberHUN translation mod](https://github.com/thendarion/timberborn-magyaritas)

A big Hungarian translation mod for Timberborn. Way more effort than I would care to admit. Still worth it though.
